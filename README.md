# MERN-Docker

This is a demo that dockerize the MERN stack - in one docker container set.

I just create the docker wrapper for the application. The code are based on the [MERN-Stack-CRUD](https://github.com/CodAffection/MERN-Stack-CRUD) by CodAffection. The application demonstrates the end-to-end CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functionarity.

## Run the demo

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 

2. Run the follow command in git
```
$ git clone https://github.com/winstonma/MERN-Docker.git
$ cd MERN-Docker
$ docker-compose up
```

3. Open browser and run `localhost:80`
